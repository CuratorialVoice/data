A companion print to BMSat 5986 by the same artist. The late ministers and the new Ministry spitting cannon-balls at each other, the former <pos>from </pos> a partly ruined castle flying a flag with a St. George's Cross. The heads are poorly characterized and few can be identified with certainty. 'Government Castle' (right) <pos>stands on the</pos> edge of a ravine <pos>into which</pos> part of it has disappeared, its door being cut vertically in half, only the right half remaining. Three heads look <pos>from</pos> the top of the tower, five emerge from lower apertures. Immediately <pos>over</pos> the door the head of the king appears, he has not ejected a cannon-ball but is saying,  My Lords and Gentlemen remember Kingdoms fall by discord . A man <pos>(right)</pos> wearing the large wig of the Speaker (Cornwall) says  To order, to order . <pos>From</pos> the mouths of the others come blasts, each <pos>connected by</pos> a dotted line with a cannon-ball to which is attached a label or streamer on which the words of the speakers are inscribed. These say:  You plague us more than Congress  (? North);  You are enemies to both Church and Castle  (this is probably from Markham, Archbishop of York, he wears a clerical wig and bands);  You expose all our plans to the enemy ;  You want our heads to get into our places ;  Our plans were good tho' unsuccessful  (Germain);  Destruction to Patriots .   The late Opposition stand <pos>below</pos> and <pos>on the right</pos> spitting out similar balls, some of which are about to descend on the heads of the defenders of the castle. A crowd of spectators stand <pos>behind them on the extreme right</pos> in two groups: three members of the group <pos>in the foreground</pos> say,  Success Boys to the Bombardment ;  Give them no Cessation  and  The Fox Bomb for ever . The other group is better dressed and is inscribed  Expecting promotion , the foremost of these is saying,  They will certainly soon surrender .   The words attached to the balls bombarding the castle are:  How much Specie have you got left?  (The speaker is probably Fox.) A man dressed as a military officer (Conway) is saying  Treat speedily with America  (a reference to Conway's famous resolutions of 22 Feb. for treating with America, and of 27 Feb. declaring its subjugation impossible, see BMSat 5963.  You have brought us to a State of Bankruptcy  (the speaker resembles Dunning).  No Landman ought to preside at the Admiralty  (the speaker appears to be Keppel). Burke (wearing spectacles) says  the war hath cost 100000000Â£ ;  You have lost us America ;  You err both in law and policy . A man turns aside, holding a handkerchief to his face, saying  This is hot work for both parties
A dog, with human arms, and wearing the coat of a naval officer, stands <pos>between</pos> a sheep <pos>(left)</pos> and a wild boar appearing <pos>from the right</pos>, its body partly cut off <pos>by the margin of</pos> the print. <pos>Round the</pos> dog's neck is a collar inscribed  I am a Govenor [sic] , indicating that he is Governor (or Commodore) Johnstone, M.P. for Lostwithiel. <pos>In his right</pos> hand is a long knife with which he cuts the throat of the perfectly placid sheep which lies <pos>on the ground</pos>. The knife is inscribed  Five S[hillings] in the Poun[d] . <pos>In his left</pos> hand he holds out to the boar a  Tax on Receipts . The boar, <pos>round whose</pos> neck is a collar inscribed  Comerce , advances snarling ferociously.   <pos>Beneath the</pos> title is a quotation from a speech by Johnstone which explains the print:  Speaking of Taxation he said there were but two Objects the Commercial & the Landed Interests, the first of these he Compared to the Hog saying if you but touch his Bristles with your finger he'll grunt & begin to roar Whereas the other was like the Sheep you might Shear his Wool & even Cut his Throat & yet he'd make no resistance nor any Noise (vide Govr   John------e on the Receipt Tax) .  See debate on the Receipt Tax, 11 June. 'Parl. Hist', xxiii. 997. Johnstone was quoting  an old member of that house
A burlesqued couple walk <pos>right to left</pos>, and <pos>slightly towards</pos> the spectator. The man bends from the waist with crooked elbows, a thin cane in one (gloved) hand. His head <pos>emerges from</pos> a swathed cravat and collar covering the cheeks; his neck is shaved, the (curled) hair <pos>projects above</pos> it. The hat has a low crown, the coat is tight and high-waisted with small tails; wide white trousers are strapped over boots with high heels to which large spurs are attached. The lady wears an enormous bonnet with high cylindrical crown, much trimmed, a projecting scoop and a chin-strap. She takes the man's right arm, pokes her head and bust <pos>forward</pos>, and carries a reticule. Both are affectedly inane
