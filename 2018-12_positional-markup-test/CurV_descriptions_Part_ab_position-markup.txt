A monster, representing Austria, puts to flight a disorderly rabble of French soldiers who fall over each other in their haste. He has enormous legs which are joined to his shoulders, probably to indicate that he is 'nobody' (cf. BMSat 5570); his head consists of a large military cap, decorated with the Habsburg eagle, <pos>from which</pos> issue enormous moustaches and two puffs of smoke (from simulated nostrils); he smokes a large curved metal pipe, and <pos>from</pos> his supposed mouth issues a blast of smoke directed against the French troops. His legs are arrogantly astride, his arms akimbo, he wears a huge sabre and spurred jack-boots. The French soldiers <pos>in the foreground</pos> are ragged and ill-armed, one holds a pitchfork, those behind have muskets. One holds up a tricolour flag inscribed 'Liberta[s]' and cries  La Liberté! La Liberté - de s'enfuir .  In <pos>the upper left corner of</pos> the design is etched:      ' While loyal honour warm'd a Fr'enchmans breast,     The field of Battle was a glorious test;    Nobly ambitious for his King to fight,    To die or conquer was a Soldiers Right
An elderly judge holding a large open book, 'Law . . . Statutes', addresses a juryman, who stands <pos>facing him</pos> in the jury-box, <pos>where</pos> the rest of the jury are registering disgust. He says:  Mr Juryman— you have requested permission to retire for a few moments—I have been looking some time for a precedent, and have at last found by the 25th of William Rufus, Chap 531, that a Juryman on any urgent occasion may retire backwards for the space of ten minutes only—therefore you may withdraw.  The juryman answers that it is no longer necessary. <pos>Between</pos> judge and juryman are three grinning barristers.   Plate numbered 347.    10 March 1815
A hand <pos>coming from</pos> a cloud holds a pair of scales. The <pos>right</pos> scale, which appears to rest <pos>on the ground</pos>, contains two books,  H. Bible  and  Sidney on G.[overnment] , surmounted by the  Cap of Liberty . <pos>On the left</pos> scale stands George III, his hands <pos>on</pos> his hips, his crown <pos>beside</pos> him, his ears project at right angles, and he is called  K. Menassah ; <pos>on</pos> a rock <pos>(left)</pos> is inscribed  II Kings Ch. xxi, Danl Chap. iv.  (the former an account of King Manasseh's reign, his wickedness and idolatry, the latter of Nebuchadnezzar's dream). A label over the scale, which <pos>issues from</pos> the hand in the clouds, is inscribed  Mene Mene Tekel Uphasin . The four ropes which support this scale are continued <pos>below</pos> it and disappear into the ground, the points of contact are inscribed  pull North ,  pull Bute ,  pull Mansfield ,  pull Devil , indicating that these four have secret influence over the king, but that their combined powers are easily outweighed by the  H. Bible , &c. <pos>Behind the centre of</pos> the scales is an irregular stone pinnacle, <pos>from the left of which</pos> a hand emerges pointing <pos>towards the</pos> king; the pinnacle is inscribed,  And he filled the Land with Blood . <pos>In the upper right corner of</pos> the print is an eye looking from a cloud, inscribed  He that formed the Eye shall he not see us . <pos>Below it is</pos> a large two-storied palace <pos>on</pos> a raised terrace, supported by a stone wall, <pos>over which</pos> is inscribed,  And Sodomites were in the Land.  <pos>Beneath the title</pos> is engraved:       Though Knaves & Fools combine how light the Scale,    But Truth & Liberty shall still prevail.   c
