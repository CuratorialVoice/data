<pos>Below</pos> the title:   To pack up her tatters and <pos>follow</pos> the Drum. Soldiers and their wives walk in single file <pos>across a</pos> stream <pos>under</pos> trees. All except for the only officer are good-looking. The procession moves irregularly <pos>from right to left</pos>, <pos>receding in</pos> perspective. <pos>In</pos> the stream <pos>(left)</pos> are two soldiers carrying their wives on their shoulders; the second carries also kettle, frying-pan, and saucepan slung from his musket; the woman has two infants tied to her shoulders. They are <pos>followed by</pos> a young woman carrying three children on her back, her petticoats raised almost to the waist. <pos>On the brink of</pos> the stream <pos>(right)</pos> is a drummer bent <pos>under</pos> a big drum and with a sword <pos>under</pos> his arm. A soldier <pos>follows</pos>, heavily burdened with musket, knapsack, inscribed Old Buffs, rolled cloak, bottle, &c., and a pouch <pos>from which</pos> hangs the head of a goose. He looks <pos>behind</pos> him at a buxom woman carrying two lusty children, and with petticoats kilted high above bare legs and tattered shoes. Last walks a woman carrying on her shoulders an ugly officer wearing plumed bicorne and gorget. The soldiers wear plumed shakos and long gaiters
Byron takes leave of his wife <pos>in</pos> the house in Piccadilly Terrace, <pos>in</pos> a small ante-room with open doors <pos>on the left and right</pos>. Byron, with his right arm round the waist of Mrs. Mardyn, walks off <pos>to the left towards</pos> a staircase, looking <pos>over</pos> his shoulder at his wife; he extends his <pos>left</pos> arm <pos>towards</pos> her, saying with a gesture of dismissal:  Fare thee well! and if for ever— Still for ever fare thee well!   He wears a Byronic collar, double-breasted tail-coat with loose trousers.  Mrs. Mardyn, very décolletée in a short, high-waisted dress, has an expression of triumph. Lady Byron, wearing a hat and holding her infant, is about to leave by the door <pos>on the right</pos>; she looks <pos>towards</pos> Byron, and is supported by Perry who puts an arm round her in a protecting manner. He is identified by a letter <pos>in</pos> his pocket: 'Letter to Mr Perry Morng Chronicle'. A hideous elderly woman, Mrs. Clermont, walks towards Lady Byron, scowling <pos>over</pos> her shoulder at Byron. She wears a large hat with flaunting feathers, and a dress like that of Mrs. Mardyn, but shorter, displaying misshapen legs. <pos>On the</pos> wall <pos>between</pos> the doors are a draped book-case and a picture of a reclining (?) Venus (left). <pos>Beneath this is</pos> a settee heaped with books and papers: 'Corsair a Poem by Lord Byron'; 'Lord Byrons New poems Farewell &'; a playbill: 'Theatre Royal Drury Lane—The Jealous Wife [Colman] after which Lovers Vows [Mrs. Inchbald] Amelia Wildenhain by Mrs Mardyn!' At Mrs. Clermont's feet is a paper: ' A Sketch from private life  &  Farewell  Two New poems by Lord Byron on his Departure for Italy & Greece.' <pos>Between</pos> her and Byron the carpet is covered with lines from 'A Sketch', beginning:   ' With Eye unmov'd & forehead unabashd    She dines from off the plate she lately wash'd.    Quick with the tale & ready with the Lie,    The Genial Confidante & General Spy
Castlereagh and Perceval rush <pos>from</pos> a doorway <pos>(right)</pos> to attack an ox, branded with a B, which snorts clouds of smoke inscribed (four times) Charges of Corruption. Castlereagh has slashed off its tail with a long knife inscribed Ministerial Hamstringer; blood spouts <pos>from</pos> the wound. He holds a paper: Cure for a Mad ox Let 310 ounces of blood, and says: I think this will tame either Mad-ox or Ass. we shall have no more of these attacks!! Perceval rushes forward <pos>behind</pos> him, flourishing a similar knife with the same inscription; he says: This is fought indeed!  / Had we done so at first, we had driven them home  / with clouts about their heads.  Shake [Antony and Cleopatra, IV. vii]. Burdett stands <pos>beside</pos> the ox pointing at Castlereagh, whom he threatens with a club inscribed Parliamentary Reform. He says: I'll tell you what my Lads, tho you find it so easy a thing to tame a Mad-ox yet I dare you all with this Cudgell
