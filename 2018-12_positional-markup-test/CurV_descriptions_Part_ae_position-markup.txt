French men-of-war are tossed helplessly by huge waves, which are lashed to fury by blasts <pos>from the mouths of</pos> <pos>(left to right)</pos> Pitt, Dundas, Grenville, and Windham, whose heads <pos>emerge from</pos> clouds. Fox is the (realistic) figure-head of 'Le Révolutionaire' <pos>(right)</pos> which, with broken masts, is about to founder. He <pos>receives</pos> the full strength of the blasts <pos>from</pos> Pitt and Dundas, and looks <pos>up</pos> despairingly, his head <pos>against</pos> the tricolour stripes <pos>which encircle</pos> the mast. Playing-cards float in the water <pos>by</pos> the ship. <pos>On the left</pos> 'L'Egalité' is wrecked by a blast <pos>from</pos> Grenville, which shatters a flag-staff, with a flag inscribed 'Vive . . Egalité'. <pos>Behind</pos>, a vessel disappears in a whirlpool. <pos>In the foreground (left)</pos> 'The Revolutionary Jolly Boat' is being swamped under the influence of a blast <pos>from</pos> Windham; the occupants throw up their hands despairingly: Sheridan, standing in the stern, is still unsubmerged; the others <pos>(left to right)</pos> are Hall the Foxite apothecary, [So Wright and Evans. He has perhaps more resemblance to Dr. Towers.]  Erskine, in wig and gown, M. A. Taylor, and Thelwall, washed overboard, with a paper: 'Thelwall's lectures' (see BMSat 8685). [Wright and Evans put Dr. Lawrence's name between that of Sheridan and Erskine; he is not depicted
George IV (scarcely caricatured) stands pompously <pos>with his back to</pos> the sea looking <pos>to the left</pos>, dressed half as field-marshal, half as admiral, his cocked hat having plume and military peak <pos>on his right</pos>, a cockade and naval peak <pos>on his left</pos>. The uniform is similarly divided. <pos>In his right hand</pos> is a baton, <pos>in his left</pos> a telescope. <pos>Behind are (left)</pos> two hussars riding off and <pos>(right)</pos> a vessel apparently flying the royal standard, and probably the King's yacht, from which a small boat rows to land
Five women, fashionably dressed, are <pos>grouped by</pos> a round table <pos>(right)</pos>. Three play cards, one <pos>(right)</pos> weeps, reading a book: 'Excessive Sensibility a Novel in 21 Volumes by the Auth[or] of Tears & Sighs / Chap 1st'. A fifth stands <pos>with her back to</pos> the others, drinking, a decanter <pos>in her right</pos> hand. A plainly dressed man wearing top-boots, and hat in hand, sits <pos>(left)</pos> <pos>in profile to the right</pos> regarding the women with consternation. <pos>Next to</pos> him the husband, fashionably dressed but clumsy, sits with hands on knees, frowning angrily. The former says:  Why Jack you terrible Turk I could not believe it if I had not seen it—Five Wives at once—why you will get yourself into a pretty scrape! what could induce you to commit such a rash action.  The other answers:  Why you must know Uncle—out of so many I was in hopes to have met with a Good One—but by St Patrick. I have been taken in—!!    Plate numbered 156
