Lord Heathfield, blowing a trumpet, rides a mule <pos>in profile to the left</pos>. The mule seems to have been suddenly pulled up, it looks <pos>up</pos> braying. He rides <pos>beside</pos> five military officers and a drummer who march in single file <pos>in the middle distance</pos> beside a paling. Their uniform is drawn with precision, and they may be portraits. All wear gaiters and carry muskets. The first <pos>(left)</pos>, who is very short and wears a gorget and a plumed helmet, may be intended for Tarleton. He is <pos>followed by</pos> a man beating a drum. The last three have numbers <pos>on</pos> their bandoliers to indicate their regiment: '18', '2' (reversed), and '59'
Irish haymakers dance wildly, the hay being all in cocks. Two men and a woman dance with linked arms, the woman flourishing a rake. The <pos>most prominent</pos> man wears his coat buttoned <pos>up the back</pos>, and holds a pitchfork whose prongs are protected by corks. He looks <pos>at</pos> a second woman, who dances <pos>close to</pos> him, her rake raised, her breast bare. A third man, <pos>close to</pos> the others, plays the fiddle as he dances. <pos>In the background</pos> a woman struggles wildly with a man who grasps her <pos>round</pos> the waist, while a second woman tries to pull him off, and threatens him with a pitchfork. A couple sit <pos>on</pos> the ground embracing. <pos>In the foreground</pos> a dog lies <pos>beside</pos> a small cask, barking at the dancers
