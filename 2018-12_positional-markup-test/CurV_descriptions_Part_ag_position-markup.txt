Napoleon stands <pos>on</pos> the shore, his head <pos>in profile to the left</pos>, holding the staff of a white flag on which are three golden bees. His <pos>left</pos> hand is raised high <pos>above</pos> his head, holding his hat which is cylindrical, with a curved brim, and a white cockade. Though not caricatured, he is dressed as Harlequin, and has a wooden sword <pos>in</pos> his belt (cf. No. 10060). <pos>On his right</pos> lrg, <pos>which is advanced</pos>, he wears a spurred cavalry boot, <pos>on the other</pos> a sabot inscribed 'Corse'. His body is <pos>covered with</pos> inscriptions, <pos>fitted into</pos> the variegated pattern of the dress which clings to his muscular figure. These record the stages of his career, starting with 'Corse' <pos>on his left</pos> foot; <pos>on his left</pos> leg: 'Buonaparte'; 'Élève de l'École Militaire'; 'Cen sans culotte'; 'Capit. d'Artillerie'; 'Gal d'Artillerie 13 Vend[émiaire]'; 'Gal de l'armée d'Italie'. <pos>On the right</pos> thigh: 'Gal de l'armée d'Egypte'; 'Bonaparte'; 'Ier Consul'; 'Restaurateur'; 'Pacificateur'; 'Consul à vie'. <pos>On the torso</pos>: 'Pdt de la Répub. Italienne'; 'Napoleon'. <pos>On the left arm</pos>: 'Emp. des Français'; 'Roi d'Italie'; 'Protecteur de la Conféd. du Rhin'. <pos>On the right</pos> arm: 'Napoleon le Grand'; 'Méd. de la Suisse'; 'Bourgeois de l'Ile de l'Elbe'. <pos>On the left</pos> is the <pos>corner of</pos> an ancient fortress. <pos>In the background (right)</pos> low mountains, with a hill-town, rise <pos>above</pos> the horizon
No. 228. A sequel to BM Satires No. 17223. The horse 'Re[form]' and its rider have fallen, <pos>surrounded by</pos> galloping wild horses with human heads. William IV, who is about to free himself from his bonds, <pos>looks up with</pos> quizzical confidence <pos>at</pos> the anxious faces that <pos>surround</pos> him. These are <pos>(left to right)</pos> Richmond (see BM Satires No. 16395) who is about to gallop off <pos>in the opposite direction</pos>, Lord John Russell, Grey, <pos>over whose</pos> back Durham has thrown a foreleg, Althorp, and Sir James Graham. All these have checked in their wild chase, but Brougham <pos>(right)<pos>, his face framed by his Chancellor's wig, still gallops on, <pos>turning</pos> his head to Mazeppa. The ground slopes <pos>towards</pos> a stream <pos>(right)</pos>; <pos>behind</pos> is a pine-tree; a carrion-bird flies <pos>towards</pos> the fallen horse

Fox says,  May I lose deal, with an honour at bottom, if Old Moll does not bring tears in my Eyes.    Mother Cole wears a hood and loose gown <pos>over</pos> her petticoat, her shoes are slashed to ease her bulging feet. <pos>By her side</pos> is a bottle labelled 'Constitution Cordial'. Fox is dressed in his customary manner; <pos>at his side</pos> is an overturned dice-box and dice. <pos>After the title is</pos> etched 'See Foot's Minor page 29
