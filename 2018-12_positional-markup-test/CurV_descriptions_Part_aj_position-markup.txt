Similar to plates to the 'Busy Body'. A very stout lady stands <pos>directed to the right</pos> reading a letter held <pos>in</pos> gloved hands. She is in full dress, very décolletée, her skirt festooned with roses; <pos>over</pos> this is worn an over-dress with a long train. Three tall feathers rise <pos>fro</pos> a gold fillet and partly hide a small crown which decorates <pos>the back of</pos> her head. <pos>Behind (left)</pos> is a pillar <pos>against which</pos> a heavy fringed curtain is festooned. This inconspicuously reveals a shield <pos>on which</pos> is a crescent and the motto 'Amo[re]'. Her attitude is that of a singer holding music and there is a resemblance, doubtless intentional, to prints of Mrs. Billington, who was associated with the peace (and with the Prince) in 1801, see Nos. 9730, 9765, 9840.   c
Street scene.   A fashionably dressed man walks <pos>(right to left) between</pos> two prostitutes, who have seized him by the shoulders and arm. One <pos>(right)</pos> hands to a man who lurks behind her a handkerchief she has taken <pos>from</pos> his pocket. A link-boy walks <pos>in front</pos> of the party holding his torch <pos>downwards</pos>. <pos>Through</pos> the glass panes which fill the upper part of the door of the bagnio <pos>(left)</pos> a woman smiles and beckons. <pos>Over</pos> the door is inscribed  WINES . The scene is probably under the piazza in Covent Garden. The women are fashionably dressed. c
The crier, his mouth wide open, with an angry expression, shakes his bell <pos>in</pos> the faces of three gaping and alarmed yokels <pos>(left)</pos>. He wears a long old-fashioned coat, broad cocked hat and wig, and holds a cane. A young man with a pitchfork <pos>(right)</pos> loiters complacently. A path leads <pos>to</pos> a farmhouse <pos>(right)</pos>. <pos>Beneath</pos> the design is engraved: 'Oyes! Oyes! This is to guie Notice, That Alice Grunt has lost from out her Stye last Night at 25 Minits past 10 o Clock two Pigs the one a black un 'tother Caroty un whoever will bring Um to the said alice Grunt - Or give inflammation where they have stolen or strayed shall have her thanks and the first sucking Pig from the Breed of old Nanny at Lammas day next - God save the King.'
