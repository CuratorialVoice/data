The <pos>interior of</pos> a shop, with open books displayed in the window and large volumes on shelves behind the counter. A well-dressed elderly man wearing spectacles, holding an open number of the magazine, displaying a print, leans <pos>on</pos> the counter <pos>towards</pos> a short thickset customer who holds a cudgel:  Ah—Ah Master Pat, so you have got my Friend Teggs Caricature Magazine—I see, and you say you want to have it handsomely bound,—suppose you have it done in Russia.  Pat answers with a puzzled frown:  Why d'ye see Honey—Russia is such a plaugy way off—I should lose the cream of the Jokes before it came back again—so if it makes no difference to you—I'll have it bound here in Dublin.  <pos>On</pos> the counter, <pos>besides</pos> ink-pot, ledger, and books is a number of the magazine, which seems to contain from two to three plates, oblong in format, and a paper inscribed 'N° 42 / Caricature Magazine / Pubd by T Tegg / 111 Cheapside'. On a pamphlet: 'Price one Shillg Col'd'.   Plate numbered 42
The Queen <pos>(left)</pos>, short, fat, and grotesque, stands on tiptoe, <pos>on</pos> an ornamental slab, to reach Bergami who stoops to kiss her. She wears feathered hat, lace-edged pelisse, and short, projecting skirt. He is dressed as a postilion, with a short furred jacket, his whip projecting <pos>from</pos> a pocket. The floor is carpeted. <pos>Below</pos> the design: 'This, to be fact is now admitted even by the Opposition!!! She doesn't stand upon trifles.' The plate is depicted in No. 14206
Three citizens seated at a small round table to drink punch, smoke, and discuss the news, are interrupted by a fat Justice <pos>(right)</pos> who stands <pos>in profile to the left</pos>, drinking from their punch-bowl. He says:  By Virtue of my Authority. I am come to taste whether there is any Sedition in the punch Bowl!!!  <pos>From</pos> his pocket protrude two papers: 'Convention Bill' and 'Riot Act'. <pos>Under</pos> his feet is the 'Bill of Rights'. The three men, grouped <pos>close together (left)</pos>, look at the intruder with expressions of angry dismay. <pos>On</pos> the table are glasses, a pipe, and newspaper: Telegraph. <pos>Under</pos> the table are two dogs, their collars inscribed John Bull and Pitt. The former <pos>(left)</pos> is closely muzzled (cf. BMSat 8693, &c); <pos>between</pos> his fore-paws is a bone <pos>at which</pos> Pitt sniffs.  17 November 1795
