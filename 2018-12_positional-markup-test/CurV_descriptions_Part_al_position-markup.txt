Tierney <pos>(left)</pos> lunges forward, his pistol levelled <pos>at</pos> Pitt <pos>(right)</pos>, who stands impassively, his pistol pointing <pos>at the ground</pos>. Fox strides <pos>forward</pos>, puts his <pos>left</pos> hand on Tierney's shoulder, and offers him a blunderbuss, saying,  You may as well shoot at a Needle you'll never hit him with that little Pop gun - here take this - it's larger in the Bore . <pos>Behind</pos> Fox and <pos>on the extreme left</pos> are Bedford, who says  That's near the Mark , and Norfolk, his hereditary Earl Marshal's baton under his arm, saying,  Take good aim . Above their heads is Abershaw's empty gibbet; a bird perched on it croaks:  plenty of room Gemmen . Pitt, very erect, says:  Arm'd with my own conscious rectitude - I I defy you all . Behind him capers Dundas, wearing tartan coat, breeches, and plaid; he holds <pos>up</pos> a constable's crowned staff, saying:  Murder! Murder. Stop the Duel Stop the Duel . The King's <pos>right hand projects into</pos> the design <pos>from the right</pos>, holding a larger staff <pos>close to</pos> that of Dundas. His words are enclosed in a label:  Stop the Duel Stop the Duel, Ha - What - ? - What - Shot! - Shot! -  . Two spectators stand <pos>in the middle distance</pos>; one looking <pos>through</pos> an eye-glass at Pitt says  Not in the least embarrass'd ; the other answers  He stands as easy as if he was in a drawing Room . <pos>In the background</pos> is a house surrounded by a paling.

Wellington, in his blue coat and white trousers, stands <pos>in profile to the left</pos> <pos>between</pos> Apsley House <pos>(right)</pos> and the Triumphal Arch on Constitution Hill still with some scaffolding (built by Decimus Burton in 1828 and afterwards temporarily disfigured by the equestrian statue of Wellington). He holds a large flat candlestick <pos>on which</pos> is a saveall (a device for burning a candle to the last drop of grease, see BM Satires No. 14362). <pos>On</pos> the saveall is an inverted ducal coronet from which <pos>projects</pos> a vice (a pun is probably intended) <pos>on which</pos> is the tiny lighted taper which the Duke is about to extinguish with his glossy top-hat. The rays are inscribed £ 15 pr An, £25 pr An. <pos>Behind</pos> a hoarding masons and hodmen are working <pos>on</pos> a scaffold <pos>against</pos> the new pillars of Apsley House, <pos>on which</pos> is a placard: Letters & Parcels to be left in Downing St [cf. BM Satires No. 15567]. <pos>In the background</pos>, also <pos>behind</pos> a hoarding, are Windsor Castle, <pos>surrounded with</pos> scaffolding but with a flag flying, and <pos>(left)</pos> the reconstructed Buckingham Palace, partly hidden by the Arch and placarded Plans Recieved here for Pulling Down
Two ladies driving in a gig, advancing <pos>diagonally towards</pos> the spectator <pos>from left to right</pos>, <pos>on</pos> the road <pos>from</pos> Hyde Park Corner <pos>to</pos> Knightsbridge. The gig, which has a crest on its panel, is drawn by a pair of ponies with long tails and manes. The lady driving is standing up, she wears the fashionable driving dress of the period, coat and waistcoat of masculine cut, full skirt without a hoop, large feathered hat; a bunch of seals hangs <pos>from</pos> her waistcoat.  Her companion <pos>(right)</pos> sits demurely with folded arms; her dress is more feminine. The faces of both are patched. The <pos>background</pos> shows the front of St. George's Hospital <pos>(left)</pos>; <pos>under</pos> the pediment is a large board inscribed 'Saint Georges Hospital for Sick'. <pos>Next</pos> it <pos>(right)</pos> is a gate <pos>into</pos> Tattersall's; <pos>over</pos> the wall appears the <pos>top of</pos> a pedestal inscribed 'Tattersal' which supports the statue of a horse
