Random sample of descriptions of prints from [2018-10-01_BMsparql.json](https://github.com/CuratorialVoice/data/blob/master/BMsparql/2018-10-01_BMsparql.json). `<pos>` tags have been added for information deemed to be 'positional': that is, where the reader is being directed to move their eyes to a point in the corresponding prints. No differentiation has been made between positional information relating to the 2d plane of the printed surface and the 3d space of pictorial representation. Markup by James Baker, December 2018.
