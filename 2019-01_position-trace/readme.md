This directory contains sample digital images of prints selected at random from [2018-10-01_BMsparql.json](https://github.com/CuratorialVoice/data/blob/master/BMsparql/2018-10-01_BMsparql.json). Each .pdf corresponds to a single print. File names are `BM-Satires_PRINTID` where `PRINTID` is the corresponding catalogue number from volumes 5 to 11 of the *[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Political_and_Personal_Satires_Preserved_in_the_Department_of_Prints_and_Drawings_in_the_British_Museum)*. Each print is annotated with two dots and a series of arrows. The dots represent the first and last position in the print described in the corresponding entry in the *[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Political_and_Personal_Satires_Preserved_in_the_Department_of_Prints_and_Drawings_in_the_British_Museum)*. The arrows mark movement between positons in the same entry. The intention is to understand the order in which the prints are described with respect to positional information on the 2d plane of the printed surface and the 3d space of pictorial representation.
